<img src="screenshots/screenshot02172017_011721309.jpg" width="100%">

**Game programming in C++ with OGRE.**

Implementation of key game programming elements in C++ using OGRE. 
Examples include level loading, path finding using A*, 
flocking using Boids, projectile motion, and collision detection.

Moving agents throughout the grid world, avoiding any obstacles along their paths.
Features A* path finding to avoid objects in the world.

### HW05: Boids

Flocking using a simple BOIDs model. Simulates cohesion, separation, and alignment of
agents.

### HW06: Physics
